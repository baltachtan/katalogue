A compilation of fully functional programs that you can copy, paste, and run. The idea is for them to be used in the form of a kata as a way to learn syntax and vocabulary through repetition.

They are arranged in alphabetical order from simple to complex. Right now it's C# and Ruby but I hope to add Javascript soon. 

Have fun and happy coding!
